Earthquake Shakes Turkey
August 19, 1999


An powerful earthquake shook a densely populated part of western Turkey early Tuesday. 

The centre of the earthquake hit Izmit, the region just south of Istanbul, the country's capital. 
Izmit is about 90 kilometres southeast of Istanbul on the Sea of Marmara. 
The area has a population of about one million. 
The earthquake hit at about 3 o'clock in the morning, while many people were still sleeping. 

Rescue workers spent hours digging through the rubble, frantically trying to save people trapped under concrete and metal. 
The earthquake has reportedly killed more than 6,000 people, and left at least 21,000 injured. 

Because of the number of injuries, Turkish hospitals are overcrowded, and can't take anymore patients. 
As a result, many of the earthquake victims were being treated on the streets. 

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8, according to the National Earthquake Information Centre in Colorado. 
Magnitude measures the amount of energy released by an earthquake. 

An observatory in Istanbul said more than 250 aftershocks followed the first tremor. 
Aftershocks are vibrations that follow an earthquake. 

Officials have warned people not to return to buildings with even some sign of structural damage, for fear there may be more collapses. 

Despite the much higher death toll, Tuesday's earthquake wasn't quite as powerful as a 1906 earthquake in San Francisco which had a magnitude of 7.9. 

Canada sent disaster assistance troops to Turkey on Wednesday night. 
The group is trained in communication and providing medical assistance.

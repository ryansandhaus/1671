Last Eclipse of the Millennium Arrives
August 11, 1999


The last solar eclipse of the millennium brightened the morning for millions of people in Europe on Wednesday. 

Many people stopped what they were doing to take a glance at history. 

Clouds blocked the view for people in some countries. 
Millions of others watched live coverage on television. 

A total eclipse is one of the most impressive natural occurrences. 
It is caused when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, blocking our view of the sun for a few minutes. 

The path of the moon's shadow began in the Atlantic, and crossed central Europe, Turkey, Iran and India. 

The maximum number of eclipses there can be in one year is seven. 
The minimum number of eclipses there can be in one year is two. 

What made this eclipse special is that it was a total eclipse, where the moon totally blocks the sun. 

These total eclipses last for a few minutes, and are rare. 
In twenty five years an astronomer who observed every total solar eclipse, would watch only about an hour of total eclipses. 

The next total eclipse won't take place until June 21, 2001. 

A partial eclipse {where the moon covers part, but not all of the sun} could be seen in Eastern Canada.

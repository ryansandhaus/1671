UN says Canada number one
July 13, 1999


For the sixth year in a row, the United Nations has ranked Canada as the best country in the world to live in. 

The United Nations decides the number one country each year by a method called the Human Development Index. 

The Human Development Index is calculated by looking at statistics about a country's citizens. 
These statistics include life expectancy (how long a person lives), quality of education, and personal income (how much money a person earns). 

Canada scored high in many areas. 

A Canadian's average life expectancy is near the top, at 79 years. 
Japan's life expectancy is 80 years old, and the United States' is at 76. 

The United Nations also said Canada's healthcare was good, placing second behind Japan. 

Canadians also have high average yearly incomes. 
Canadians earned $16,525 US a year in 1997. 
That is better than many countries, but below top countries like Norway and Japan. 

Not all of the UN report was good news. 
Canada ranked ninth in the world when it came to dealing with poverty. 

The UN says technology may be improving life for people in developed countries like Canada, but it is also widening the gap between rich and poor people. 

Many countries disagree with the way the United Nations gathers its information to decide the best countries in the world. 

But the UN says the Human Development Index is a comprehensive measure of a country's standard of living.
